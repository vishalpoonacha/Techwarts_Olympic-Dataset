# OLYMPIC 2021

The modern Olympic Games or Olympics are leading international sporting events featuring summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the world participate in a variety of competitions. The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating. The Olympic Games are normally held every four years, alternating between the Summer and Winter Olympics every two years in the four-year period.
Note: Tasks 2-3 for top 15 countries alone

**Task :** 

1. Clean all the datasets provided if present (impute NANs, either using your own logic or mean, median, mode. Converting all country names to upper case or lower case). Remove all the countries with zero medals.
2. Draw a co-relation between the population of the country and {gold, silver, bronze, total medal tally}. Hint: Use the data in the Google sheet and convert it to CSV, and then merge it as a new column (titled 'population') with the medals dataset. Use Plotly for graphs.
3. Draw a co-relation between independence year of the country and {gold, silver, bronze, total medal tally}. Hint: Use the data in the Google sheet and convert it to CSV, and then merge it as a new column (titled 'independence year') with the medals dataset. Use Plotly for graphs
4. In the EntriesGender.xlsx, you'll notice details about the entries of men and women into different disciplines. **Using code**, we want you to determine the top 3 disciplines which have the highest divide in men's entries vs women's entries (excluding the sports in which either men or women participants are 0 such as Artistic Swimming). If you feel like it, drop in a line or two about your reasoning as to why you think this difference occurs.

Bonus question:

Count the number of men-only disciplines (Olympics events are referred to as discipline) and woman-only disciplines. Which gender has the highest disciplines? Hint: Needs cleaning to the entries and imputing long texts to the specific gender.[dataset in Teams.xlsx]
